            <h2>Welcome to My Coding Journey!</h2>
            <p>
                Ever wonder how a simple idea transforms into something visible and deployable? I did too. Building this blog was part art, part science, and 100% patience. Think of it as raising a digital baby—there was fumbling with HTML, wrestling with CSS, and an all-out duel with JavaScript.

<!--------------------------------- Tech Trends Section --------------------------------->
        <section id="trends">
            <h2>Tech Trends & Innovative Technologies</h2>
            <p>Technology moves fast. Blink, and you might miss something revolutionary. 
                Here are some of the real trends and innovations I stumbled across recently that caught my eye:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>AI Tools:</strong>
                    <p>Tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and DALL·E are reshaping productivity and creativity. 
                        Generative AI isn’t just about answering questions; it’s helping write code, design graphics, and automate entire workflows. 
                        The future belongs to those who can collaborate with AI.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Web3 Innovations:</strong> 
                    <p>The decentralized web is here to change how we view ownership and interaction online. From smart contracts to NFTs, these technologies are pushing digital boundaries—whether for finance, art, or gaming.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Low-Code Platforms:</strong>
                    <p>Tools like Webflow, Bubble, and Zapier are democratizing development, letting non-coders build websites, apps, and workflows. 
                        It’s no longer just about writing code; it’s about solving problems efficiently.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> 
                    <p>As devices become smarter and IoT continues to grow, edge computing ensures data is processed closer to the source. 
                        This innovation reduces latency and paves the way for real-time solutions in healthcare, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dark Mode & Accessibility:</strong> 
                    <p>Whether you’re a night owl or just someone who values inclusivity, trends like dark mode, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), and responsive design ensure websites are usable for everyone.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Tech Solutions:</strong> 
                    <p>From energy-efficient data centers to green coding practices, sustainability in tech is gaining momentum.
                        Innovations like carbon-aware cloud computing (e.g., Microsoft’s carbon-conscious AI) are leading the way.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Each of these trends excites me because they aren’t just about cool tools—they’re about solving real problems.
            </p>

            </blockquote>

            <h2>What am looking forward to:</h2>
            <p>I believe innovation isn’t limited to Silicon Valley or big tech hubs. 
                My country is brimming with untapped potential, and technology can help unlock it.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Remote Work & Digital Skills:</strong>
                    <p>Platforms like Upwork and Coursera allow local talent to compete globally.
                        Coding, design, and data analytics are no longer skills of the future, they’re skills of right now.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fintech Solutions:</strong>
                    <p>Mobile money services (think M-Pesa) have already transformed access to financial tools. 
                        The next step? Blockchain-based payment solutions and AI-driven credit scoring to support underserved communities.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Agri-Tech: </strong>
                    <p>From smart irrigation to crop analytics using IoT and drones, technology can transform agriculture and empower farmers.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>As someone passionate about tech, I look forward to seeing—and contributing to—projects that make a real impact. 
                Whether it’s better education tools, healthcare systems, or local innovations going global, the future looks promising.</p>
